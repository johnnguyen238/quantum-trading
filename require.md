Use a quantitative (quantum) algorithm to determine the trend and identify Long and Short entry points.
Scenario 1: If the price moves in line with the trend, keep the position unchanged.
Scenario 2: If the quantitative (quantum) algorithm determines that the trend remains unchanged but the price has not yet followed the trend, place additional Long and Short orders using an x2 DCA method to cover the position.
Scenario 3: If after entering a Long or Short position the quantum algorithm determines that the trend has changed, liquidate the position.

The bot will automatically adjust the leverage to an appropriate level.

Conduct backtesting and store data on trading orders and market conditions to retrain the AI and improve the bot’s performance.
